# Supervised-project HEC Montr√©al "Exploration of machine Learning Methods: an Application to German Wholesale Electricity Market"

The objective of this project is to explore machine learning models using german wholesale electricity market data. 
I used Python and Jupyter notebook to implement models. There is five notebooks containing the following models:

Ordinary Least Squares - in this notebook I fit a multivariate linear regression to predict demand and day ahead price and to evaluate what it is possible to do with a simple statistical model.
Then, I estimate two models for demand prediction and two models for price prediction.

DEMAD PREDICTION :
Random Forest,
XGBoost  

PRICE PREDICTION :
Logistic regression, 
LSTM neural networks
