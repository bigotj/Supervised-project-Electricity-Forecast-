# Supervised-project HEC Montréal "Exploration of machine Learning Methods: an Application to German Electricity Market"

The objective of this project is to explore machine learning models using german electricity market data. It is part of my M.Sc in applied financial economics at HEC Montréal.

The data I used is coming from two sources : 1) ENTSOE for electricty market data, 2) DWD for weather data.
Dataset available on GitHub. 

I used Python Sickit Learn and Keras to train the models. 
The code is presented in jupyter Notebook format. There is five notebooks containing the following models:

Ordinary Least Squares - for price and demand prediction 
Random Forest - for demand prediction 
XGBoost - for demand prediction 
Logistic regression - up or down price classifier 
LSTM neural networks - for price prediction
